# perlscripts
Handy Perl scripts I once wrote

check_Dates.pl  - Useful for the management of public resources. Send emails; when no contact after 180 days reclaim public resources.

log.pl - Some understanding of host density ratio and how to use the log function on the command line/with perl  

addng_new_nodes.pl - Adding new nodes to clustermanager with minimal "cut configuration lines, adjust configuration lines, paste configuration lines"

bright_gethealthdata.pl - Get node health data details from the clustermanager command

gitpresent.pl - Script to get a listing of commits made, in a repository, on the actual day, including filename.

gitpresent_mWF.pl - Script to get a listing of commits made, including filename, from a repository, since the day you specify, using the English abbreviated month and day of the month.
