# perlscripts
handy perl scripts i once wrote

check_Dates.pl  - Useful for the management of public resources. Send emails; when no contact after 180 days reclaim public resources.

getrelated_email.pl - Harvest email addresses from ripe database objects ( works with the ripe whois client which has more elite options, it seems as though it has been deprecated, also the script has a cute humble comment about spagetti code however it looks pretty clean and straight forward, i had yet to learn about multidimensional arrays and hashes to really understand those "write once spagetti code" comments about perl, so perhaps spagetti code is a wrong description) Also spagetti should be spaghetti. Also it looks like ripe ncc should revert what they changed to their systems to have this script function again.

log.pl - Some understanding of host density ratio and how to use the log function on the command line/with perl  

addng_new_nodes.pl - Adding new nodes to clustermanager with minimal "cut configuration lines, adjust configuration lines, paste configuration lines"

bright_gethealthdata.pl - Get node health data details from the clustermanager command
